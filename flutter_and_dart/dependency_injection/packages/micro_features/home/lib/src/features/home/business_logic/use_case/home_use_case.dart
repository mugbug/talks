/// It's the component where we'll process all the data we need,
/// apply business logic to it to create an object that is easy to use
/// on the presentation layer
///
/// In practice, here is where you will get 1+ DTOs from 1+ repositories
/// and condense it all into a single entity
///
/// For instance, let's say we have an API that we can fetch a user's name
/// and another API that we can fetch a user's birth date.
/// We'll use this information to present in a screen the following text:
/// "User Andr√© Katz was born in 15/09/1995"
///
/// To do this, we will return a simple entity, that will enable us to do this:
/// "User {entity.name} was born in {entity.date}"
