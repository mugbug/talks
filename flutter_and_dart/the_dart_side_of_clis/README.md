## Slides

You can find the slides for the presentation in the _marp_ format [here](slides/full_presentation.md).

## Getting Started üöÄ

If the CLI application is available on [pub](https://pub.dev), activate globally via:

```sh
dart pub global activate the_dart_side_of_clis
```

Or locally via:

```sh
make install
```

## Usage

```sh
# open_url command
$ the_dart_side_of_clis open_url https://google.com

# semantic_linter command
$ the_dart_side_of_clis semantic_linter -m "feat: example"

# Show CLI version
$ the_dart_side_of_clis --version

# Show usage help
$ the_dart_side_of_clis --help
```

## Creating a new command üìù

1. Install local bricks (templates)

```sh
$ mason get
```

2. Use mason's VSCode extension to create a new local brick and choose the `command` one.

3. Modify as you'd like and reference it on `TheDartSideOfClisCommandRunner`.

4. Install it and give it a try:

```sh
$ make install

# test it out
$ the_dart_side_of_clis <your-command>
```

## Running Tests with coverage üß™

To run all unit tests use the following command:

```sh
$ make tests
```

To view the generated coverage report you can use [lcov](https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov).

```sh
$ make lcov
```
