## Creating a new command üìù

```

2. Use mason's VSCode extension to create a new local brick and choose the `command` one.

3. Modify as you'd like and reference it on `TheDartSideOfClisCommandRunner`.

```sh
$ make install

# test it out
$ the_dart_side_of_clis <your-command>
```

## Running Tests with coverage üß™
