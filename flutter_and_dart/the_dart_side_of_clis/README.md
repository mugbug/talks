dart pub global activate the_dart_side_of_clis
```

```sh
dart pub global activate --source=path <path to this package>
```

## Creating a new command 📝

1. Install local bricks (templates)

```sh
$ mason get
```

2. Use mason's VSCode extension to create a new local brick and choose the `command` one.

3. Modify as you'd like and reference it on `TheDartSideOfClisCommandRunner`.

4. Install it and give it a try:

```sh
$ make install

# test it out
$ the_dart_side_of_clis <your-command>
```

## Running Tests with coverage 🧪

To run all unit tests use the following command:

```sh
$ dart pub global activate coverage 1.2.0
$ dart test --coverage=coverage
$ dart pub global run coverage:format_coverage --lcov --in=coverage --out=coverage/lcov.info
```

To view the generated coverage report you can use [lcov](https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov)
.

```sh
# Generate Coverage Report
$ genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/

# Open Coverage Report
$ open coverage/index.html
```
