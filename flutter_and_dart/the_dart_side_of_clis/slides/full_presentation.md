# The **Dart** Side of CLIs

---

# Agenda

- ***What*** is a CLI?
- ***When*** it makes sense to create a custom one?
- And ***how*** would we do it?

---

# What is a **CLI**?

A tool that knows how to execute one or more commands and may accept extra arguments for customization.

---

###### What is a **CLI**?

## Examples

- flutter
- dart
- very_good
- flutterfire

---

# ***When*** it would make sense to create a custom CLI?

---

###### ***When ...***

... we need to **mix many commands** and/or scripts together in a relatively **complex** way

---

###### ***When ...***

... we have one or more **script that is shared** between many projects and teams and we need to keep it always up to date for all of them

---

###### ***When ...***

... we want to easily **add automated tests** to our scripts

---
###### ***When ...***

... we want to provide a single and **easy-to-find hub of tooling** to all team members

---

###### ***When ...***

... we want to **boost knowledge sharing** across teams

---

# But **how** would we do it?

---

# üë©‚Äçüíª It's **cooode** time!
